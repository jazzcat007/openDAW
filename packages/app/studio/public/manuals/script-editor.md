# Script Editor

The script editor lets you write a few lines of TypeScript that create a new project or change the one you have open.
You find it under openDAW menu > Script Editor.

The complete documentation lives at `/docs/scripting/`, with a guide, a cookbook and
the reference of everything a script can touch. This page covers the editor itself.

## Running

The File menu has two starting points, **New Create Script** and **New Edit Script**, with the necessary lines already
in place. Auto-completion is your guide while typing. Type `project.` and the editor lists everything that is
available, with a short description for each property and method.

Press **Run**. A script that creates a project opens it in the studio. A script that edits the open project applies
its changes as a single undo step, so you can take them back with one undo.

## Saving scripts

Scripts are saved in your browser with a name and a description and are included in the [cloud backup](/manuals/cloud-backup).

- **Save** (Cmd/Ctrl + S) and **Save As...** (Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + S) are in the File menu.
- **Scripts** (Cmd/Ctrl + O) opens the list of your scripts, where you can open, rename and delete them.
- **Import Script...** and **Export Script...** read and write plain `.ts` files.

## Examples

The editor comes with example scripts. They show a first melody, an acid line with drums, a generated sample on an
audio track, a wavetable for Nano, an inventory of the open project and a cleanup script. You can delete them, and
newer openDAW versions replace them with updated copies. The same scripts are explained in the
[cookbook](/docs/scripting/guide/09-cookbook/).
